This Python program template includes:
1. Library Imports: Standard and third-party library imports are organized and documented. The template includes all commonly used Machine Learning and AI libraries, such as TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, NLTK, spaCy, Gensim, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, OpenCV, and OpenAI, along with the previously included standard and third-party libraries. Developers can utilize this template as a foundation for their Python projects, incorporating the required functionality and leveraging the rich ecosystem of Machine Learning and AI libraries available in Python.
2. Variable Initialization: Global variables and logging setup are initialized.
3. Function Declarations: Functions are defined with rich documentation explaining their purpose and usage.
4. Main Function: The main function orchestrates the program execution, calling other functions as necessary.
5. Exception Handling: Comprehensive exception handling is implemented to catch and log errors gracefully.
6. Main Execution Block: The main execution block invokes the main function and handles keyboard interrupts.

Developers can use this template as a starting point for their Python projects, filling in the specific logic and functionality as needed while maintaining the structure and best practices outlined in the template.
